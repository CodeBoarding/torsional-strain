## Details



Advanced Molecular Modeling subsystem



### Molecular Symmetry Function Generator

This component is responsible for the creation of molecular symmetry functions. These functions are crucial for representing molecular environments in a rotationally and translationally invariant manner, serving as robust features for machine learning models in computational chemistry. It encapsulates the algorithms and logic required to transform raw molecular structural data into a numerical feature vector suitable for machine learning.

### ML Model Training Orchestrator

This component manages the entire workflow for training machine learning models within the `torsion` project, specifically for tasks related to molecular properties such as torsional strain. It orchestrates the collection and preparation of input data (including features generated by the `Molecular Symmetry Function Generator`), handles the definition and configuration of the machine learning model architecture, and executes the training process, including optimization and evaluation.
